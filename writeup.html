    <h1>Prototype Write-up</h1>
    <h2>What have you done so far?</h2>
    <p>We have completed the basic structure for this nutrition dashboard, allowing users to enter their sex, height, weight, and age as inputs to estimate their daily caloric recommendations. 
        We have integrated dataset loading and processing that will enable various food choices, providing their caloric breakdown and macronutrient values. 
        Users can now compose meals and track them throughout the day, complemented with bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs. 
        We have categorized the meals by time so that foods can be selected based on breakfast, lunch, snack, or dinner for efficient tracking. </p>
    <h2>What will be the most challenging part of your project to design and why?</h2>
    <p>Creating a functional recommendation system that suggests meals based on the user's residual caloric and macronutrient needs will pose the biggest challenge. 
        This is going to be paired with the dilemma of making dynamic data updates to ensure that recommendations remain nutritionally balanced and related throughout the day. 
        The next challenge is to optimize performance because the large size of the dataset and graphic rendering in real time can slow down the dashboard and need efficient data porting. 
        Lastly, making sure that there is a good interface that is very user-friendly and easy to understand is a key issue since users are interacting with complex nutritional data in such a way that they do not feel overwhelmed.</p>
